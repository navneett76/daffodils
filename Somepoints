Testing: 

Karma: 
Karma is a tool which lets us spawn browsers and run jasmine tests inside of them all from the command line. The results of the tests are also displayed on the command line.

Karma can also watch your development files for changes and re-run the tests automatically.

Karma lets us run jasmine tests as part of a development tool chain which requires tests to be runnable and results inspectable via the command line.

-- async will allow the next test not to start until the async finishes all it's tasks. What async does is wrap the callback in a Zone, where all asynchronous tasks (e.g. setTimeout) are tracked. Once all the asynchronous tasks are complete, then the async completes.
